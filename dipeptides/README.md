This collection contains all possible dipeptides formed from all common variants of the standard amino acids, terminated with ACE and NME groups.  It also includes a pair of cystine residues connected by a disulfide bond.  There are 677 molecules in total, each with 50 conformations.

The conformations were generated using OpenMM 7.6, PDBFixer 1.8.1, RDKit 2020.09.3, Open Babel 3.1.1, OpenFF Toolkit 0.10.0, and MDTraj 1.9.5.
