This collection consists of dimers, each involving of a ligand and a single amino acid.  The conformations are drawn from PDB files.

The files `Components-smiles-oe.smi` and `cc-to-pdb.tdd` were downloaded from [Ligand Expo](http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/ld-download.html).

The conformations were generated using OpenMM 8.0, RDKit 2023.03.2, OpenFF Toolkit 0.14.0, and openmmforcefields 0.11.2.
